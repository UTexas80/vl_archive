<h2>Create a Processed Version of the Ames Housing Data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Create a Processed Version of the Ames Housing Data
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
make_ames()

make_ames_new()

make_ordinal_ames()
</pre>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>For the processed version, the exact details can be found in
the code of <code>make_ames</code> but a summary of the differences between
these data sets and <code>ames_raw</code> is:
</p>

<ul>
<li><p> All factors are <em>unordered</em>.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>PID</code> and <code>Order</code> are removed.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Spaces and special characters in column names where changed
to snake case. To be consistent, <code>SalePrice</code> was changed to
<code>Sale_Price</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Many factor levels were changed to be more understandable
(e.g. <code>Split_or_Multilevel</code> instead of <code>080</code>)
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Many missing values were reset. For example, if the variable
<code>Bsmt_Qual</code> was missing, this implies that there is no basement
on the property. Instead of a missing value, the value of
<code>Bsmt_Qual</code> was changed to <code>No_Basement</code>. Similarly, numeric
data pertaining to basements were set to zero where appropriate
such as variables <code>Bsmt_Full_Bath</code> and <code>Total_Bsmt_SF</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>Garage_Yr_Blt</code> contained many missing data and was removed.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Approximate longitude and latitude are included for the
properties. Also, note that there are 6 properties with
identical geotags. These are units within the same building.
For some properties, updated versions of the PID identifiers
were found and are replaced with new values.
</p>
</li></ul>

<p><code>make_ordinal_ames</code> is the same as <code>make_ames</code> but many factor
variables were changed to class <code>ordered</code> (see below).
</p>
<p>The documentation for <code><a href="../../AmesHousing/help/ames_raw.html">ames_raw()</a></code> contains descriptions of
the columns although, as noted above, the column names in
<code><a href="../../AmesHousing/help/ames_raw.html">ames_raw()</a></code> are slightly different from the processed
versions.
</p>
<p><code>make_ames_new()</code> creates a data set of new properties. These were populated
using less data sources than the original and lack a number of the condition
and quality. Both properties were unsold at the time of this writing.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A tibble with the data.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

nrow(ames)
summary(ames$Sale_Price)

ames_ord &lt;- make_ordinal_ames()
