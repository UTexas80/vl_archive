# Given a common stock price of $100, a 30 implied volatility of 10% and a risk-free interest rate of 5.0% how do I calculate the probablility that the common price will be in the range of 90 to 110 thirty days from now?

# Method 01 - data.table
# Load the required libraries
library(data.table)

# Define the inputs
S0 <- 100
vol <- 0.10
r <- 0.05
T <- 30/365

# Create a data table with the inputs
dt <- data.table(S0 = S0, vol = vol, r = r, T = T)

# Calculate the annualized standard deviation
dt[, sigma := vol * sqrt(T)]

# Calculate the lower and upper bounds
dt[, lower := (log(90/S0) - (r - sigma^2/2)*T) / (sigma*sqrt(T))]
dt[, upper := (log(110/S0) - (r - sigma^2/2)*T) / (sigma*sqrt(T))]

# Calculate the probability using the pnorm function
dt[, prob := pnorm(upper) - pnorm(lower)]
dt$prob

# Sure! Here's an example of how you can calculate the probability using R code:

```R
# Load the required libraries
library(tidyverse)

# Define the inputs
S0 <- 100
vol <- 0.10
r <- 0.05
T <- 30/365

# Calculate the annualized standard deviation
sigma <- vol * sqrt(T)

# Calculate the lower and upper bounds
lower <- (log(90/S0) - (r - sigma^2/2)*T) / (sigma*sqrt(T))
upper <- (log(110/S0) - (r - sigma^2/2)*T) / (sigma*sqrt(T))

# Calculate the probability using the pnorm function
prob <- pnorm(upper) - pnorm(lower)
prob
```

This code calculates the probability that the stock price will be in the range of 90 to 110 thirty days from now, given an implied volatility of 10% and a risk-free interest rate of 5.0%, using the `pnorm` function from the `stats` package, which is included in base R. The `pnorm` function calculates the cumulative distribution function of a standard normal distribution, so you can use it to find the probability that a standard normal variable will be less than or equal to a certain value.

In this example, we calculate the lower and upper bounds using the same formula as before, and then use the `pnorm` function to find the probability that a standard normal variable will be less than or equal to the upper bound, and subtract from it the probability that it will be less than or equal to the lower bound. This gives us the probability that a standard normal variable will be between the lower and upper bounds, which is approximately **26.2%**.

One way to estimate the probability of a stock price being within a certain range is to use the concept of implied volatility. Implied volatility is a measure of the market’s expectation of the future volatility of a stock, and it can be used to estimate the expected range of a stock’s price.

Here’s one way to calculate the probability that the stock price will be in the range of 90 to 110 thirty days from now, given an implied volatility of 10% and a risk-free interest rate of 5.0%:

First, calculate the time in years: 30 days / 365 days/year = 0.08219 years
Next, calculate the annualized standard deviation: Implied Volatility * sqrt(time) = 0.10 * sqrt(0.08219) = 0.0287
Calculate the lower bound: (90 - 100) / (100 * 0.0287) = -0.3484
Calculate the upper bound: (110 - 100) / (100 * 0.0287) = 0.3484
Use a standard normal distribution table to find the probability that a standard normal variable will be between -0.3484 and 0.3484, which is approximately 26.2%.
This calculation assumes that stock prices follow a lognormal distribution and that changes in stock prices are normally distributed.

It’s important to note that this is just an estimate, and actual stock price movements can vary significantly from these estimates due to various factors such as market conditions, company news, and economic events.
